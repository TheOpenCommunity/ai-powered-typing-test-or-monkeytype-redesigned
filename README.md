# About

Monkeytype AI is a minimalistic and customizable AI-powered typing test. Adjust user-configurable features such as themes, typing contents and more by simply generating using AI.

Monkeytype AI attempts to emulate a natural typing experience during a typing test by unobtrusively presenting the text prompts and displaying typed characters in place, providing straightforward, real-time feedback on typos, speed, and accuracy. 

When a user makes a typing mistake, the app instantly regenerates the current word, creating a new, correct English word that continues from the mistaken letter. This means users no longer need to stop and correct errors manually, allowing for a smoother and more efficient typing process.


# Current Features

- minimalistic design, with optional advertisements and focus mode while typing
- type what you see, see what you type
- ai generated content with default mode
- live errors, wpm, and accuracy displays
- seemlessly collaborate with ai
- ai generated content with punctuation and numbers, enter what you wish
- a variety of test lengths; 15s, 30s, 45s
- ai generated themes, your imagination matters
- collaborative themes, save yours for everyone
- and much more
